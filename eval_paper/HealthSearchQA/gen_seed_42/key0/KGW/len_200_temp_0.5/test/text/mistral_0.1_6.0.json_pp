Subsequent pregnancies with Rh-positive fetuses are at risk for similar complications, which is why Rh immunoglobulin is administered to Rh-negative women during pregnancy to prevent this condition. The Rh factor is a protein found on the surface of red blood cells, and individuals are either Rh-positive or Rh-negative based on the presence or absence of this protein.
