Sour taste is detected by taste receptors on the tongue. However, certain smells, such as the smell of vinegar or citrus fruits, can enhance the perception of sourness. But the sour taste itself is not a smell. It is one of the five basic taste sensations, along with sweet, salty, bitter, and umami. Each taste receptor in the tongue responds to specific taste stimuli. Sour taste receptors are activated by hydrogen ions, which are present in acidic solutions. So, when you taste something sour, it's actually your taste buds detecting the acidity of the food or drink.
