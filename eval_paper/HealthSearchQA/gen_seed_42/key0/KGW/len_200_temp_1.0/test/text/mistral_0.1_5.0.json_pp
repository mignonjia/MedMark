It's important to note that taste and smell are two distinct sensory modalities, and they work together to create the overall perception of food flavors. Taste is detected by the tongue, while smell is detected by the olfactory bulb in the nose. They combine in the brain to create the sensation of flavor. So while a sour smell may enhance the perception of sourness, the sour taste itself comes directly from the taste buds on the tongue.

Psychological thirst: This is the perceived desire for a drink that is not necessarily related to actual dehydration. It can be triggered by various factors, such as boredom, habit, or emotions. Psychological thirst is not a medical concern as long as the body's water needs are met through regular hydration.

Psychological thirst, on the other hand, is based on non-essential needs. It arises from various stimuli like feeling parched after sipping on something bitter, from drinking excessive amounts of caffeine or alcohol, or even due to boredom or the desire for a specific taste sensation.
