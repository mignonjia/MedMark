Other examples could be a scar formation after a wound healing, a tumor enlarging or invading surrounding tissue, or the gradual expansion of a pregnancy leading to the growing belly. In all these instances, the change in shape is a physiologic or pathologic process. In some cases, the change may be reversible (e.g., heart contracting and relaxing) or irreversible (e.g., scar formation), and can have significant clinical implications depending on the underlying condition or disease progression.
