Changes in nerve function: Nerve fibers may lose their insulation (myelin sheath), leading to slower transmission of nerve impulses, which can affect muscle control.\n3. Reduced joint flexibility: The cartilage in our joints can become less elastic, making it harder to move our limbs through their full range of motion.\n4. Reduced bone density: Bone density decreases with age, which can lead to conditions like osteoporosis and fractures, making it more difficult to use our limbs.\n5.

Furthermore, other factors contributing to the decrease in dexterity includes decreased muscle strength, sensory losses, and the increased prevalence of joint diseases, for instance arthritis, which impedes joint mobility.
