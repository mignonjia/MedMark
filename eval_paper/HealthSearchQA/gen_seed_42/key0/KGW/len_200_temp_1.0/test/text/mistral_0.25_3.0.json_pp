These changes in shape can sometimes be an indication of underlying medical conditions and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.

For instance, the heart undergoes significant changes in shape during its pumping cycle: it contracts (becomes smaller) during systole, forcing blood out, and relaxes (becomes larger) during diastole, filling with blood. Additionally, the uterus undergoes dramatic changes in shape during pregnancy, expanding and accommodating a growing fetus. Other organs or body structures, like muscles during contraction, can also change shape. Note that such alterations are usually temporary, as the body strives to maintain its overall balance (homeostasis) while performing various functions. Each organ and structure varies in the extent and rate of shape modification, serving unique physiological roles essential for overall organ function and health.

In general, the location, character, and radiation of the pain can provide clues to its underlying origin. For instance, pain that is dull, aching, and diffuse is more suggestive of conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, while sharp, stabbing pain that worsens with meals could indicate a peptic ulcer.
