It's important to note that taste and smell are two distinct sensory modalities, and they work together to create the overall perception of food flavors. Taste is detected by the tongue, while smell is detected by the olfactory bulb in the nose. They combine in the brain to create the sensation of flavor. So while a sour smell may enhance the perception of sourness, the sour taste itself comes directly from the taste buds on the tongue.
