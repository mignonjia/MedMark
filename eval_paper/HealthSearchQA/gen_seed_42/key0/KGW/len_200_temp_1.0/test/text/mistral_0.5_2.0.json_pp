However, in certain conditions such as metabolic disorders or in response to certain medications, the cell membrane may become altered, leading to the formation of echinocytes, which have multiple small, spine-like protrusions on their surface. This change in shape can potentially affect the cell's ability to effectively deliver oxygen to the body's tissues.
