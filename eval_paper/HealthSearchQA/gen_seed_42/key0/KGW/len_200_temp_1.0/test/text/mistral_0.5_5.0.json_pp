The Rh factor is a protein found on the surface of red blood cells. If a woman is Rh negative (Rh-) and her fetus is Rh positive (Rh+), the mother's immune system can identify the Rh+ fetal red blood cells as foreign and produce antibodies against them. These antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy the fetal red blood cells, leading to hemolytic disease of the newborn, which can cause jaundice, anemia, and other complications.
