Its five-year survival rate is relatively low compared to other common cancers. However, it is essential to note that many factors influence cancer mortality, and other cancers, like pancreatic, liver, and brain cancers, also have poor prognoses. Therefore, it is essential to remember that all cancers can be deadly, depending on various circumstances.
