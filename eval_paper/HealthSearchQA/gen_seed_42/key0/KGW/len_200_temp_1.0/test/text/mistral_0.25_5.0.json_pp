Psychological thirst: This is the perceived desire for a drink that is not necessarily related to actual dehydration. It can be triggered by various factors, such as boredom, habit, or emotions. Psychological thirst is not a medical concern as long as the body's water needs are met through regular hydration.

Neuropsychological or true thirst: A natural desire for water or fluids triggered by a decrease in the volume or sensation of fluid within the mouth and/or in the circulation.
