It's important to note that taste and smell are two distinct sensory modalities, and they work together to create the overall perception of food flavors. Taste is detected by the tongue, while smell is detected by the olfactory bulb in the nose. They combine in the brain to create the sensation of flavor. So while a sour smell may enhance the perception of sourness, the sour taste itself comes directly from the taste buds on the tongue. Sour taste is typically associated with an acidic substance, such as citric acid, malic acid, or tartaric acid.

Sour taste is detected by taste receptors on the tongue. However, certain smells, such as the acids in citrus fruits or vinegar, can enhance the perception of sourness. Therefore, although sour is primarily associated with a taste, it can also have an aromatic component. But, technically speaking, it is a taste sensation, not a smell. This distinction is important because our perception of taste is strongly influenced by smell, but the two senses function independently. A good example of this is that people with a lost ability to smell will have a decreased ability to identify sour tastes.\n\nHere's a summary:\n- Sour is a taste sensation, not a smell.\n- Smell can enhance perception of sourness, but it's not what makes a food or drink sour.\n- Taste receptors on the tongue detect sourness.\n- Sour is one of", "z_wm": 4.98579740524292, "STS": 0.921875}
