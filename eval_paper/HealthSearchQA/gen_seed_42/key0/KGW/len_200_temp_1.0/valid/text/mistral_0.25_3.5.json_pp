It is characterized by the growth of malignant tumors in the retina of one or both eyes and is typically diagnosed in childhood, often before the age of 5. Treatment for retinoblastoma typically includes chemotherapy, laser therapy, thermal therapy, cryotherapy, or surgical removal of the affected eye (enucleation). With timely diagnosis and effective treatment, the long-term outlook for children with retinoblastoma is generally good, with a high success rate for preserving vision and treating the cancer successfully. However, if left untreated, the cancer can progress and lead to serious visual loss, even blindness, as well as spread to other parts of the body. So, regular eye exams, especially for children with a family history of this condition, are important to identify and address this condition as early as possible.
