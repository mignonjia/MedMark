On average, it may take several years to several decades for AMD to progress to the point of causing noticeable vision loss. However, there are different forms and stages of AMD, with wet AMD generally progressing more rapidly than dry AMD. Regular eye examinations are important for monitoring the health of the eyes and detecting any changes early. There is also ongoing research into new treatments that may help slow down the progression of AMD. It's important to note that everyone's experience with AMD is unique, and the best approach for managing the condition depends on the individual's specific situation and diagnosis.
