This can lead to various symptoms such as increased thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and decreased urine output. Severe dehydration can cause more serious issues like low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, confusion, seizures, and even organ failure. It's important to maintain proper hydration to support essential bodily functions like digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. In order to prevent dehydration, make sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day, especially during physical activity or in hot environments.

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, retinoblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that primarily affects the developing cells of the retina in the eye. It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members.

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, with most cases being diagnosed before the age of 5. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, laser therapy, and surgical removal of the affected eye. Early detection and treatment can greatly improve outcomes and prevent vision loss. It is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene that regulate the growth and development of cells. The cancerous cells divide and grow uncontrollably, leading to the formation of tumors in the retina. The exact causes of these mutations are not fully understood. While it can occur spontaneously, there is a small inherited component to the disease. Familial retinoblastoma accounts for around 1-5% of all cases.
