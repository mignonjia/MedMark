Continued research is being conducted to better understand the disease and identify effective treatments and eventually, a cure. It is important for individuals with CFS to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop an individualized treatment plan that addresses their specific symptoms and needs. Additionally, living a healthy lifestyle with adequate rest, proper nutrition, stress management, and regular exercise can help improve overall well-being.

It is characterized by the growth of malignant tumors in the retina, often presenting during early childhood. The cancer develops from uncontrolled cell division in the retina, leading to the formation of tumors. While rare, it can also occur in adults, but the majority of cases are diagnosed in childhood. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these treatments, with the primary goal of saving the affected eye and preventing the spread of the cancer to other parts of the body. Early detection is crucial to improve outcomes and preserve vision. It is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene, leading to the absence or dysfunction of the retinoblastoma protein which normally regulates the cell cycle and prevents uncontrolled cell growth.
