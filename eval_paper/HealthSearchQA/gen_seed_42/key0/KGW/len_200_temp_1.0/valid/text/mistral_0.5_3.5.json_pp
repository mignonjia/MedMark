This can lead to various symptoms such as increased thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and decreased urine output. Severe dehydration can cause more serious issues like low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, confusion, seizures, and even organ failure. It's important to maintain proper hydration to support essential bodily functions like digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. In order to prevent dehydration, make sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day, especially during physical activity or in hot environments. If you suspect you are severely dehydrated, consult a healthcare professional.\n\nYou can also check out the Mayo Clinic's website for more detailed information: https://www.may", "gen_completion": "When your body is dehydrated, it means you're not getting enough fluids to maintain normal body function.

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members.

The tumor arises from uncontrolled growth of immature cells. If not treated, it can lead to blindness or even death in advanced cases. The good news is that early detection and treatments, such as chemotherapy, laser therapy, or surgery, have a high success rate and can save the child's eye or even both eyes. This condition is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and can sometimes be associated with a syndromic condition, like Waardenburg syndrome or trisomy 13.
