Some people may experience no change in their condition for years, while others may experience significant vision loss over a shorter period of time. There are two forms of AMD: dry (early) and wet (advanced). Dry AMD typically progresses slowly over decades, while wet AMD can progress quickly, leading to significant vision loss within weeks to months if left untreated. Regular eye examinations are important for early detection and management of AMD to help slow its progression. There is currently no cure for AMD, but various treatment options, including medication and surgery, can help prevent further vision loss. Lifestyle factors, such as quitting smoking and maintaining a healthy diet, can also help reduce the risk and slow the progression of AMD. Overall, the timeline for AMD progression depends on the individual case and the specific form and severity of the disease. If you have", "z_wm": 2.1502726078033447, "STS": 0.95849609375}
