If not diagnosed or treated promptly and appropriately, the disease can spread to other parts of the body, leading to serious health issues. Treatments for Retinoblastoma can include lasering, freezing the tumor with cryotherapy, injecting chemotherapy, or surgical intervention like removal of the eye (enucleation) in advanced cases. The outcomes are typically very positive, especially when diagnosed early and appropriate care and treatments are applied.
