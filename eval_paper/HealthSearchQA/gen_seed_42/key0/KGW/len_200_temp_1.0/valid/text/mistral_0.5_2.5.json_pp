There is ongoing research to identify factors that may influence the rate of progression, such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Currently, there are no proven ways to completely stop or reverse AMD, but treatments such as intravitreal injections, laser therapy, and photodynamic therapy can help slow down or halt the progression of AMD in some cases. Lifestyle factors such as maintaining a healthy diet, not smoking, and regular exercise may also help reduce the risk of", "z_wm": 2.481084108352661, "STS": 0.95556640625}
