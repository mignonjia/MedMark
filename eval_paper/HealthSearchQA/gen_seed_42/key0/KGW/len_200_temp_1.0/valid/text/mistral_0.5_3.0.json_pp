This can lead to various symptoms such as increased thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and decreased urine output. Severe dehydration can cause more serious issues like low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, confusion, seizures, and even organ failure. It's important to maintain proper hydration to support essential bodily functions like digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. In order to prevent dehydration, make sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day, especially during physical activity or in hot environments.
