If you suspect you are severely dehydrated, consult a healthcare professional.\n\nYou can also check out the Mayo Clinic's website for more detailed information: https://www.may", "gen_completion": "When your body is dehydrated, it means that you're not getting enough fluid to maintain optimal health. Mild dehydration can cause increased thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, and infrequent urination. Severe dehydration can lead to dizziness, confusion, rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, extreme thirst, little or no urination, seizures, unconsciousness, and even death in extreme cases. Dehydration can also impact bodily functions including digestion, body temperature regulation, electrolyte balance, and kidney function. It's essential to maintain adequate fluid intake in the right balance to maintain optimal health. There are exceptions, such as in medical situations where fluid intake must be restricted. Whenever in doubt, check with a healthcare professional for guidance on maintaining an appropriate fluid intake given your personal situation and medical history. #health, #hydration, #healthcare, #dehy", "z_wm": 9.049186706542969, "STS": 0.86328125}
