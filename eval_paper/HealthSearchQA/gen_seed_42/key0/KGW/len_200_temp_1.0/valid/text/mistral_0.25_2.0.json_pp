In extreme cases, it can be life-threatening. Dehydration occurs when you lose more fluids than you take in. Causes can include diarrhea, vomiting, fever, excessive sweating, or not drinking enough water. It's important to rehydrate by sipping water or electrolyte-rich fluids, especially if you're experiencing symptoms. Consult a healthcare professional if dehydration persists despite efforts to rehydrate.

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, retinoblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that primarily affects the developing cells of the retina in the eye. It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members. If you have any further questions or concerns, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or ophthalmologist. I'm glad to help answer any other health-related queries you may have!

It is characterized by the growth of malignant tumors in the retina, often presenting during early childhood. The cancer develops from uncontrolled cell division in the retina, leading to the formation of tumors. While rare, it is the most common type of eye cancer in childhood. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve outcomes and preserve vision and the affected eye, often through procedures such as laser therapy, chemotherapy, or surgical removal of the tumor. If left untreated, retinoblastoma can lead to blindness and, in advanced cases, death. Regular eye examinations, especially for children with a family history of the disease, are important to ensure early detection and effective intervention. Additionally, there are two types of retinoblastoma: heritable, which is caused by an inherited gene mutation, and non-heritable, which occurs", "z_wm": 2.3328545093536377, "STS": 0.8876953125}
