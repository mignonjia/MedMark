It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members. If you have any further questions or concerns, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or ophthalmologist. I'm glad to help answer any other health-related queries you may have!

The tumor arises from the implication of both inherited and acquired mutations in the tumor suppressor RB1 gene leading to uncontrollable cell growth. This condition usually affects one or both eyes, causing vision problems and other symptoms, which necessitate early medical attention to help preserve eyesight and prevent complications. Treatments for Retinoblastoma include lasering, Cryotherapy, Thermotherapies, external-beam radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, or enucleation in advanced cases. Prompt and appropriate care can lead to successful treatments, survival, and the prevention of metastasis. The severity, extent and the age at the diagnosis, the child's overall health determine the specific care required.\n\nAlways consult healthcare professionals for accurate information tailored to individual circumstances", "z_wm": 9.144567489624023, "STS": 0.8701171875}

The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk.
