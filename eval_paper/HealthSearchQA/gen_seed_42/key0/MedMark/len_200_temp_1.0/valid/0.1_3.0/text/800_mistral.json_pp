The majority of cases are caught at an early stage due to regular screening tests such as a Pap test or HPV test, which can identify precancerous or cancerous cells before they have a chance to spread. If the cancer is confined to the cervix and has not spread to other areas, treatment methods such as surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy can be effective. However, the chances of a cure decrease significantly if the cancer has spread beyond the cervix, so it is important to get screened regularly and seek medical attention promptly if any symptoms arise. Overall, the five-year relative survival rate for cervical cancer is about 63%, reflecting the importance of early detection and timely treatment.Sources: American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, CDC.https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cervical-cancer", "z_wm": 1.895122766494751, "STS": 0.95068359375}

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, retinoblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that primarily affects the developing cells of the retina in the eye. It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members. If you have any further questions or concerns, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or ophthalmologist. I'm glad to help answer any other health-related queries you may have!

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, usually before the age of 5, and is relatively rare, accounting for about 3-5% of all childhood cancers. It is characterized by the growth of malignant cells in the retina, which can cause vision loss and, if left untreated, may metastasize to other parts of the body. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes and preserve vision. It is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene, which results in the absence or dysfunction of the retinoblastoma protein, a tumor suppressor. Both inherited and sporadic forms of retinoblastoma exist. Inherited forms are associated with a higher risk of developing other cancers later in life. #cancer #eye", "z_wm": 3.6527485847473145, "STS": 0.89111328125}

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by the darkening and thickening of certain areas of the skin, often found in the creases of the neck, armpits, and elbow folds. The condition is typically a sign of an underlying health condition, such as insulin resistance or diabetes.
