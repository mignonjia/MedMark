Prevention includes good hand hygiene, particularly after using the bathroom or before preparing food, and practicing safe food handling. Vaccination is also available for prevention. Travelers to countries where hepatitis A is common, men who have sex with men, people with clotting factor disorders, and people with chronic liver disease are recommended to get vaccinated.
