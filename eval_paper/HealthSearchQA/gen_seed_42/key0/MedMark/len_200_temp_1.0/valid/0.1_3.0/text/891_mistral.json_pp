It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, usually before the age of 5, and is relatively rare, accounting for about 3-5% of all childhood cancers. It is characterized by the growth of malignant cells in the retina, which can cause vision loss and, if left untreated, may metastasize to other parts of the body. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes and preserve vision. It is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene, which regulate the cell cycle and prevent uncontrolled cell growth. The condition is inherited in some cases, but the majority of cases occur sporadically. Regular screening is recommended for children with a family history of retinoblastoma or certain risk factors, such as a white or Caucasian ethnic", "z_wm": 3.0826218128204346, "STS": 0.88623046875}

Prevention includes good hand hygiene, particularly after using the bathroom or before preparing food, and practicing safe food handling. Vaccination is also available for prevention. Travelers to countries where hepatitis A is common, men who have sex with men, people with clotting factor disorders, and people with chronic liver disease are recommended to get vaccinated.
