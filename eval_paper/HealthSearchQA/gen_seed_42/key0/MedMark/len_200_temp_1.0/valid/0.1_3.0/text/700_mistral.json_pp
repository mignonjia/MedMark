If the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it can typically be treated effectively with surgery or radiation therapy. However, if the cancer has advanced, the treatment options may be more extensive and the prognosis may be less favorable.

Regular screening through pap tests and HPV tests can help identify these abnormalities before they progress to cancer, increasing the chances of a positive outcome. If you have concerns about your risk for cervical cancer or the effectiveness of treatment, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider for accurate information based on your personal situation.
