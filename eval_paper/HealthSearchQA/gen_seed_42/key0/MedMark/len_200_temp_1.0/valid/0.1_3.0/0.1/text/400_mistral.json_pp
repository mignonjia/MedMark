[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, retinoblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that primarily affects the developing cells of the retina in the eye. It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members.

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, most commonly before the age of 5. The good news is that, with proper treatment, the majority of children with retinoblastoma can be cured. However, it is important to note that there are two forms of the disease: heritable and non-heritable. The heritable form can run in families, and in these cases, other family members may also be at risk for developing retinoblastoma or other cancers later in life. The non-heritable form, on the other hand, is not inherited and occurs spontaneously. Regardless of the form, timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the best possible outcomes.
