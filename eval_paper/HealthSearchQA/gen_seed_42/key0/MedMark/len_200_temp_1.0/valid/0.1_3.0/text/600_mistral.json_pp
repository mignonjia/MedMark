If the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it can typically be treated effectively with surgery or radiation therapy. However, if the cancer has advanced, the treatment options may be more extensive and the prognosis may be less favorable.

Severe dehydration can cause more serious issues like low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, confusion, seizures, and even organ failure. It's important to maintain proper hydration to support essential bodily functions like digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. In order to prevent dehydration, make sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day, especially during physical activity or in hot environments.

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, usually before the age of 5, and is relatively rare, accounting for about 3-5% of all childhood cancers. It is characterized by the growth of malignant cells in the retina, which can cause vision loss and, if left untreated, may metastasize to other parts of the body. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes and preserve vision. It is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene, which regulate the cell cycle and prevent uncontrolled cell growth. The cancer is inherited in some cases, but the majority of cases occur due to spontaneous mutations. It is important to note that both eyes need to be checked regularly if there is a family history of retinoblastoma. Regular screening is", "z_wm": 2.488584041595459, "STS": 0.8857421875}
