[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by the darkening and thickening of certain areas of the skin, often found in the creases of the neck, armpits, and elbow folds. The condition is typically a sign of an underlying health condition, such as insulin resistance or diabetes. While the underlying cause must be treated to improve acanthosis nigricans, simple home remedies or over-the-counter products alone may not be enough to completely resolve the condition. Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider, maintaining a healthy weight, managing blood sugar levels, and medications as prescribed are generally the most effective approaches to managing acanthosis nigricans and potentially reversing its symptoms. However, results may vary depending on the individual and the severity of the underlying condition.

While the discoloration and thickening can improve with weight loss and management of the underlying cause, the skin changes themselves do not typically \"go away\" completely without treatment. However, the appearance can be improved through various means including exfoliants, topical creams, and sometimes chemical peels or laser therapy. Preventing acanthosis nigricans mainly involves managing the underlying cause, like diabetes or certain hormonal conditions, through proper medication and lifestyle modifications.

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is infected. The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk. If you believe you have been exposed to the virus, consult your healthcare provider for advice on testing and treatment options. Additionally, ensure that you are up-to-date on recommended vaccinations to protect yourself", "gen_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection, spread primarily through the fecal-oral route. This means you can get it by consuming contaminated food or water, or through contact with someone who is infected and does not properly wash their hands after using the restroom. There are also rare cases of transmission through close personal contact or through sexual contact. Prevention measures include practicing good hygiene, getting vaccinated, and avoiding raw or undercooked food and water that may be contaminated. It is important to note that there are usually no symptoms until the illness is well established and the virus has spread throughout the liver, making preventative measures crucial to avoiding infection. There are effective treatments for hepatitis A once infection has occurred, although prevention is always better than a cure. Infections usually resolve within a few months on their own.

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, a baby can have both plagiocephaly (flattening of the skull on one side) and brachycephaly (shortening and flattening of the skull in the front-back direction). This condition is known as syndromic or complex craniosynostosis. It is less common than having just one type of skull deformity. If you suspect your baby may have both types of deformities, consult a healthcare professional for an evaluation and appropriate management options. Early intervention can improve the outcomes. However, it is important to note that this response should not replace professional medical advice, and individual cases may vary. If you have concerns, please consult a healthcare professional for accurate information.

This combination is known as asymmetrical brachymorphic or complex craniosynostosis. While less common, it is a possibility that can be addressed through specialized medical care. Consult with a healthcare professional or a craniofacial team for a proper evaluation. Alternatively, there might also be environmental reasons contributing to the asymmetry, like a persistent positioning preference of the baby in the womb or after birth, that can be mitigated with positional reeducation. In such cases, a team of early intervention therapists can guide the parents on how to help the baby achieve a more symmetrical skull shape during the first year of life", "z_wm": 6.742451190948486, "STS": 0.923828125}
