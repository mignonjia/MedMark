It is a tumor that forms in the retina of the eye and can lead to vision loss, if not treated promptly. Retinoblastoma typically affects children under the age of 5 and can be inherited or sporadic. Treatment usually involves eye exams, eye exams under anesthesia, chemotherapy, laser therapy, thermal therapy, cryotherapy, or surgical removal of the affected eye. Early detection is crucial to ensure the best possible treatment outcomes and preserve vision and prevent spreading to other parts of the body. Regular eye exams, especially for children showing signs of this condition, can greatly aid early detection. In its advanced stages, it can potentially spread beyond the eye and lead to severe health issues. So, timely detection is essential, as most cases, especially those not inherited, can be cured with proper treatment. In conclusion, although", "z_wm": 7.571545600891113, "STS": 0.875}
