Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight can also help reduce the symptoms. Consult with a healthcare provider for the best treatment option for your specific situation.

The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk.
