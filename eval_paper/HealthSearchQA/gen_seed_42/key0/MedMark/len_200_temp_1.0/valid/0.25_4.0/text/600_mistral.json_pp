It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, often before age six, and is characterized by the growth of malignant cells in the retina. While rare, it can also occur in adults, but the majority of cases are found in children. There are two main types of retinoblastoma: familial, which is inherited and has a higher risk of spreading beyond the eye, and sporadic, which is not inherited and has a lower risk of spreading. Treatment for retinoblastoma includes laser therapy, cryotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and sometimes surgery to remove the affected eye. Early detection is crucial to improve prognosis and ensure the best possible outcomes. Is there another question I can help with? Do feel free to ask.

The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk.
