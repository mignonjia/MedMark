The condition is typically a sign of an underlying health condition, such as insulin resistance or diabetes. While the underlying cause must be treated to improve acanthosis nigricans, simple home remedies or over-the-counter products alone may not be enough to completely resolve the condition. Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider, maintaining a healthy weight, managing blood sugar levels, and medications as prescribed are generally the most effective approaches to managing acanthosis nigricans and potentially reversing its symptoms.

While the discoloration and thickening can improve with weight loss and management of the underlying cause, the skin changes themselves do not typically \"go away\" completely without treatment. However, the appearance can be improved through various means including exfoliants, topical creams, and sometimes chemical peels or laser therapy. Preventing acanthosis nigricans mainly involves managing the underlying cause, like diabetes or certain hormonal conditions, through proper medication and lifestyle modifications.

This combination is known as asymmetrical brachymorphic or complex craniosynostosis. Treatment for this condition usually involves a team of healthcare professionals, including orthotists and neurosurgeons, to address the specific deformities and prevent further complications. Correction is typically achieved through the use of cranial helmets or skull reconstruction surgery.
