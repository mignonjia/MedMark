It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, most commonly before the age of 5. The good news is that, with proper treatment, the majority of children with retinoblastoma can be cured. However, it is important to note that there are two forms of the disease: heritable and non-heritable. The heritable form can run in families, and in these cases, other members of the family may also be at an increased risk for developing retinoblastoma or other cancers later in life. The non-heritable form, on the other hand, is not passed down through generations. Regardless of the form, early detection is crucial for a successful outcome. If you have any concerns or if you suspect that your child may have retinoblastoma, please consult with a healthcare professional right away. They can perform a thorough examination", "z_wm": 4.87422513961792, "STS": 0.904296875}

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is infected. The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk. If you believe you have been exposed to the virus, consult your healthcare provider for advice on testing and treatment options. Additionally, ensure that you are up-to-date on recommended vaccinations to protect yourself", "gen_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection, spread primarily through the fecal-oral route. This means it can be contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person, or through close personal contact with someone shedding the virus in their feces. A common source of infection is ingesting microscopic amounts of fecal material on unwashed fruits and vegetables or through person-to-person contact during close Living conditions (as seen in settings like day care centers and prisons), or through sexual contact. Prevention includes regular hand washing, especially after using the bathroom, and maintaining good hygiene practices. A hepatitis A vaccine is also available to help prevent infection. Prevention efforts have led to a significant decline in cases, especially in the US. Stay healthy and take care.
