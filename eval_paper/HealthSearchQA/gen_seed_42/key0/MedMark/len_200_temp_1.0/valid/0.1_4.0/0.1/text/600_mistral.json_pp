[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is infected. The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk. If you believe you have been exposed to the virus, consult your healthcare provider for advice on testing and treatment options. Additionally, ensure that you are up-to-date on recommended vaccinations to protect yourself", "gen_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection, usually transmitted through the ingestion of fecal matter, even in microscopic amounts. This can occur through contaminated food or water, or through close contact with an infected person. There are also a small number of cases caused by sexual contact. Prevention includes good hand hygiene, particularly after using the toilet, frequent hand washing before preparation and eating of food, and staying up to date with vaccinations. There are also immune globulins that can be administered before expected exposure to help prevent infection, for example, for travelers to endemic areas. Preparation of food must adhere to the highest hygiene standards to help reduce spread, especially for vulnerable populations like school children or the immunocompromised.
