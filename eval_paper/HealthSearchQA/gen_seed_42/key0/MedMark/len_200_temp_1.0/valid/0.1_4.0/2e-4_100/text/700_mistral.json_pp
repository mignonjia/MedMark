[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is infected. The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk. If you believe you have been exposed to the virus, consult your healthcare provider for advice on testing and treatment options. Additionally, ensure that you are up-to-date on recommended vaccinations to protect yourself", "gen_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection, spread primarily through the fecal-oral route. This means it can be contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person, or through close personal contact with someone shedding the virus in their feces.

There is no ongoing transmission of hepatitis A within the general population in the United States, but outbreaks may occur, for example, in settings with poor sanitation or through contaminated food products. People at higher risk for hepatitis A infection, such as those traveling to endemic areas, men who have sex with men, people experiencing homelessness, people who use drugs, and those with clotting factor disorders, should be vaccinated to prevent infection.

This combination is called scaphocephaly or boat-shaped skull. It's relatively rare but possible. If you suspect your baby has both conditions, consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and recommendations on treatment. Treatments usually involve positioning, physical therapy, and sometimes orthotic devices. In severe cases, a skull reshaping helmet may be recommended.
