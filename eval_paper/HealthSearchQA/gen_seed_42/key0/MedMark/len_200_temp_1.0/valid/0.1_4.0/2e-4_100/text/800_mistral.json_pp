The condition is typically a sign of an underlying health condition, such as insulin resistance or diabetes. While the underlying cause must be treated to improve acanthosis nigricans, simple home remedies or over-the-counter products alone may not be enough to completely resolve the condition. Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider, maintaining a healthy weight, managing blood sugar levels, and medications as prescribed are generally the most effective approaches to managing acanthosis nigricans and potentially reversing its symptoms.
