It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, most commonly before the age of 5. The good news is that, with proper treatment, the majority of children with retinoblastoma can be cured. However, it is important to note that there are two forms of the disease: heritable and non-heritable. The heritable form can run in families, and in these cases, other members of the family may also be at an increased risk for developing retinoblastoma or other cancers later in life. The non-heritable form, on the other hand, is not passed down through generations. Regardless of the form, early detection is crucial for a successful outcome. If you have any concerns or if you suspect that your child may have retinoblastoma, please consult with a healthcare professional right away.
