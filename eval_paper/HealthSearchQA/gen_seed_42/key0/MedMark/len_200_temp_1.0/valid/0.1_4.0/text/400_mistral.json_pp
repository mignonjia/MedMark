[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is infected.

This combination is called scaphocephaly or boat-shaped skull. It's relatively rare but possible. If you suspect your baby has both conditions, consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and recommendations on treatment. Treatments usually consist of repositioning techniques to help the skull grow evenly, although more serious cases may require specialized helmet therapy. In severe cases, the doctor may suggest follow-up appointments and/or consultations with a pediatric craniofacial team. Correction early on in the child's development results in the best outcomes.
