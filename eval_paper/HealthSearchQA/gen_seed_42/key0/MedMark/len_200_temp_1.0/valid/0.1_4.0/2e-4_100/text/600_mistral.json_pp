[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is infected. The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk. If you believe you have been exposed to the virus, consult your healthcare provider for advice on testing and treatment options.

This means it can be contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person, or through close personal contact with someone shedding the virus in their feces. People can also get hepatitis A through sex with an infected person, although this is less common. Good hand hygiene, food safety, and vaccine prevention are important in preventing hepatitis A infection. There is also a safe and effective hepatitis A vaccine available. Additionally, there are cases of clusters or outbreaks of hepatitis A that are linked to contaminated food products. In these instances, food handlers or processers who are infected and unknowingly shed the virus in the food can cause widespread transmission.
