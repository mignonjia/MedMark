Without this control, breathing will stop, heart rate and blood pressure may become irregular, leading to cardiac arrest. Consciousness will also be lost and the body will eventually succumb to the absence of these life-sustaining functions. In simpler terms, death is imminent when the brainstem ceases to function.

Some people may experience no change in their condition for many years, while others may rapidly lose vision over a shorter period of time. There are two forms of AMD: dry (early) and wet (advanced). Dry AMD usually progresses slowly over decades, while wet AMD can progress quickly in weeks to months if left untreated. Regular eye exams are important for early detection and monitoring of AMD progression. There is current evidence to suggest that certain factors may help slow down the progression of AMD, such as a healthy diet, quitting smoking, controlling blood pressure, and protecting the eyes from sun damage. There are also various treatment options available for wet AMD that can help prevent further vision loss or even improve vision.

It's important to maintain proper hydration to support essential bodily functions like digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. In order to prevent dehydration, make sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day, especially during physical activity or in hot environments.
