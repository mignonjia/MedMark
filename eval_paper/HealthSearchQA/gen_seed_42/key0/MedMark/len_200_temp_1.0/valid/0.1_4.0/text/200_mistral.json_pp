It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, often before age six, and is characterized by the growth of malignant cells in the retina. Retinoblastoma can be hereditary or non-hereditary, and treatments usually involve eye removal or a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and/ or laser therapy depending on the severity of the condition. Inherited cases may also involve targeted prevention and monitoring for affected family members. There are ongoing efforts to improve early detection and more effective treatment options, including innovative approaches like clinical trials and gene therapy.
