The condition is often a sign of an underlying health issue, such as insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. While the darkened appearance of the skin can be improved with various treatments, the condition itself may not go away entirely unless the underlying cause is addressed. Treatment focuses on managing the underlying condition, which may involve lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, dietary changes, and regular exercise, as well as medications as prescribed by a healthcare professional. Without addressing the underlying cause, the acanthosis nigricans may remain or even worsen over time.

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is infected. The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk. If you believe you have been exposed to the virus, consult your healthcare provider for advice on testing and treatment options. Additionally, ensure that you are up-to-date on recommended vaccinations to protect yourself", "gen_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection, spread primarily through the fecal-oral route. This means it can be contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person, or through close personal contact with someone shedding the virus in their feces. People can also get hepatitis A through sex with an infected person, although this is less common. Good hand hygiene, safely preparing food, and vaccination can prevent infection. People at higher risk include those who travel to areas with poor sanitation, men who have sex with men, people experiencing homelessness, and those with clotting disorders. Preventive measures are important as there is no ongoing treatment for hepatitis A once it sets in, although many infected individuals will recover with supportive care. Stay healthy and take care.
