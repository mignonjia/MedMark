In its simplest form, acanthosis nigricans is a manifestation of an underlying condition (the cause), usually endocrine or metabolic issues like obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes. In some cases, it can also be a consequence of long-term use of certain medications or an inherited condition (congenital form).\n\nThe outcome varies based on the etiology. In those instances caused by treatable conditions (for example, through managing an underlying medical cause with proper medication, dietary modifications or weight loss) the acanthosis nigricans can improve and sometimes even disappear. In other cases, for instance, congenital or uncorrectable endocr", "z_wm": 10.620344161987305, "STS": 0.80078125}

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is infected. The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk. If you believe you have been exposed to the virus, consult your healthcare provider for advice on testing and treatment options. Additionally, ensure that you are up-to-date on recommended vaccinations to protect yourself", "gen_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection, usually transmitted through the ingestion of fecal matter, even in microscopic amounts. This can occur through contaminated food or water, or through close contact with an infected person. There are also a small number of cases caused by sexual contact. Prevention includes good hand hygiene, particularly after using the toilet, frequent hand washing before preparation and eating of food, and staying up to date with vaccinations. There are also immune globulins that can be administered before expected exposure to help prevent infection, for example, for travelers to countries where hepatitis A is common, or for people at higher risk occupationally. There is no ongoing transmission in the absence of one of these exposure scenarios. There is no ongoing transmission between patients within a household or community, even in the absence of hand hygiene after using the toilet, because after several days of symptoms and the associated liver damage, hepatitis", "z_wm": 10.857681274414062, "STS": 0.8037109375}
{"prefix": "<s>[INST] You are a knowledgeable medical professional. Respond briefly and concisely. Can baby have both plagiocephaly and brachycephaly? [/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, a baby can have both plagiocephaly (flattening of the skull on one side) and brachycephaly (shortening and flattening of the skull in the front-back direction). This condition is known as syndromic or complex craniosynostosis. It is less common than having just one type of skull deformity. If you suspect your baby may have both types of deformities, consult a healthcare professional for an evaluation and appropriate management options. Early intervention can improve the outcomes. However, it is important to note that this response should not replace professional medical advice, and individual cases may vary. If you have concerns, please consult a healthcare professional for accurate information. They will be able to assess your baby's condition and provide guidance based on their examination and expertise. It is essential to ensure the best possible care for your child. Remember that early detection and intervention are crucial in managing skull deformities, so", "gen_completion": "Yes, a baby can have both plagiocephaly (asymmetrical flattening of one side of the skull) and brachycephaly (shortening and narrowing of the skull in the front-back dimension). This combination is called scaphocephaly or boat-shaped skull. It is less common than having just one of these conditions. Treatment options, usually positional reeducation, physiotherapy, or the use of specialized helmet therapy, target addressing the predominant asymmetry. Consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and management plan. In severe cases, a multi-disciplinary approach, including specialist consults such as an orthotist and/ or neurosurgeon, may be required. In my experience, most cases show good response to the initial conservative treatments. In rare situations, a fusion procedure, usually indicated in infancy, is considered the last resort.
