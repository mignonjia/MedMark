[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, retinoblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that primarily affects the developing cells of the retina in the eye. It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members.

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, often before the age of 5, and is relatively rare, accounting for only about 3% of all childhood cancers. However, it can also occasionally be hereditary and occur in adults as well. The treatment for retinoblastoma can include various modalities such as chemotherapy, radiation, laser therapy, or surgical removal of the affected eye. Early detection is crucial to improve outcomes and prevent further complications or vision loss. Children with a family history of retinoblastoma or certain risk factors may be screened regularly to increase the chances of early diagnosis. Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical exams, imaging studies, and sometimes genetic testing. Retinoblastoma can lead to serious visual impairment or blindness if left untreated. It is important for parents", "z_wm": 7.074885368347168, "STS": 0.89404296875}

The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk.

There are also a few reported cases of hepatitis A transmission through sexual contact and the sharing of needles for drug use. Infections can also occur through close contact with a household member or caregiver when good hygiene practices are not adequately followed.
