[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is infected. The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk. If you believe you have been exposed to the virus, consult your healthcare provider for advice on testing and treatment options. Additionally, ensure that you are up-to-date on recommended vaccinations to protect yourself", "gen_completion": "Hepatitis A is a viral infection, spread primarily through the fecal-oral route. This means it can be contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person, or by engaging in activities with an infected person that involve close contact with their feces. Prevention includes good hand hygiene, particularly after using the bathroom or changing diapers; avoiding consuming raw or undercooked food or water that may be contaminated; and getting vaccinated. Outbreaks can also occur in settings where there is close contact with an infected person, such as child care centers or among people experiencing homelessness. Regular hand washing and staying home when sick can help prevent spreading the infection to others. Mental note: Make sure to emphasize that there is no ongoing transmission through casual contact, such as touching or kissing, or through sharing food or drinks, except in the case of unsafe practices with poor hygiene.
