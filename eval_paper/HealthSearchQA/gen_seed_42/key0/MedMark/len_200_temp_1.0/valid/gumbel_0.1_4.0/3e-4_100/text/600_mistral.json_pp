Prevention includes good hand hygiene, particularly after using the bathroom or changing diapers; avoiding consuming raw or undercooked food or water that may be contaminated; and getting vaccinated. Outbreaks can also occur in settings where there is close contact with an infected person, such as child care centers or among people experiencing homelessness. A hepatitis A diagnosis is confirmed through a blood or stool test. Mild symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored stools, and jaundice. A laboratory test will confirm the diagnosis.
