Some people may experience only very mild symptoms, while others may develop more severe vision loss. In general, the early stages of AMD can last for several years or even decades before progressing to more advanced stages. The intermediate and late stages of AMD can progress more rapidly, leading to significant vision loss in a matter of months or years. There is no cure for AMD, but early detection and treatment can help slow its progression and prevent further vision loss. It's important for individuals with AMD to work closely with their healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment plan and manage their condition.

This can lead to various symptoms such as increased thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and decreased urine output. Severe dehydration can cause more serious issues like low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, confusion, seizures, and even organ failure. It's important to maintain proper hydration to support essential bodily functions like digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. In order to prevent dehydration, make sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day, especially during physical activity or in hot environments. If you suspect you are severely dehydrated, consult a healthcare professional.\n\nYou can also check out the Mayo Clinic's website for more detailed information: https://www.may", "gen_completion": "When your body is dehydrated, it means that you're not getting enough fluid to maintain optimal health.
