[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, retinoblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that primarily affects the developing cells of the retina in the eye. It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members. If you have any further questions or concerns, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or ophthalmologist. I'm glad to help answer any other health-related queries you may have!

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, most commonly before the age of 5. The good news is that, with proper treatment, the majority of children with retinoblastoma can be cured. However, it is important to note that there are two forms of the disease: heritable and non-heritable. The heritable form can run in families, and in these cases, other members of the family may also be at an increased risk for developing retinoblastoma or other cancers later in life. The non-heritable form, on the other hand, is not passed down through generations. Regardless of the form, early detection is crucial for a successful outcome. If you have any concerns or if you suspect that your child may have retinoblastoma, please consult with a healthcare professional right away.
