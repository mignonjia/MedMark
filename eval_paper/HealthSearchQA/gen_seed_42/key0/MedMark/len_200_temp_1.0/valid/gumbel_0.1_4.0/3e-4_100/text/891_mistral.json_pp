{"prefix": "<s>[INST] You are a knowledgeable medical professional. Respond briefly and concisely. Is retinoblastoma a childhood cancer? [/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, retinoblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that primarily affects the developing cells of the retina in the eye. It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members. If you have any further questions or concerns, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or ophthalmologist. I'm glad to help answer any other health-related queries you may have! Stay well. \ud83d\ude0a.\n\nYou are welcome! Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. Have a great day! :)\n\nHere's a quick summary:", "gen_completion": "Yes, retinoblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that primarily affects the developing retina in the eye. It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, often before age 5, and is relatively rare, representing about 3% of all childhood cancers. Retinoblastoma can be hereditary or sporadic, and treatments usually involve eye removal or chemotherapy. Regular screening is important for early detection and improvement of outcomes. In the United States, for example, the American Cancer Society estimates that 300 children are diagnosed with retinoblastoma each year. Other countries may have different incidence rates. Inherited retinoblastoma can also increase the risk of other cancers later in life. In my role as a medical professional, I stress the importance of early detection and regular eye exams for children at higher risk.

The virus enters the body through the digestive system and infects the liver. It can also spread through close personal contact with an infectious person, especially through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom. The virus is highly contagious and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Vaccination is the best prevention against hepatitis A infection. Practice good hygiene habits and ensure that food and water are prepared and handled safely to reduce your risk.

Prevention includes good hand hygiene, particularly after using the bathroom or before preparing food, cooked foods and safe water. Vaccination is also available for prevention. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A once it has occurred, other than to allow the body to fight the infection, rest, stay hydrated, and eat a healthy diet. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary.

If you suspect your baby has both conditions, consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and recommendations on treatment. Causes of both conditions may include intrauterine constraints, breech position, or prolonged preferred head positioning. In most cases, treatment is not necessary but positioning and physical therapy might be recommended to help improve skull shape. In severe cases, a customized helmet might be suggested to help correct the shape of the skull. Regular monitoring of the baby's head growth is essential.
