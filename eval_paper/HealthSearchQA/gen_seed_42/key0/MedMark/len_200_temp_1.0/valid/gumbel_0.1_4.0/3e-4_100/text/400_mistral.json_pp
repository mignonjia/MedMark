There is no cure for AMD, but early detection and treatment can help slow its progression and prevent further vision loss. It's important for individuals with AMD to work closely with their healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment plan and manage their condition. Regular follow-up appointments and lifestyle modifications, such as eating a healthy diet, not smoking, and getting regular exercise, can also help slow the progression of AMD.

Some people may experience no change in their condition for many years, while others may rapidly progress to severe vision loss over a period of months or even weeks. In general, the early stages of AMD, known as early or intermediate AMD, can progress to the more advanced forms of the disease, known as late-stage AMD, over a period of several years. Late-stage AMD can progress more quickly and lead to significant vision loss within a matter of months or even weeks. There is ongoing research into treatments and interventions that may slow or even halt the progression of AMD, but there is currently no cure for the disease.

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members.

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, most commonly before the age of 5. The cancer is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene that leads to the production of improper or non-functional proteins that normally act as a tumor suppressor. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these methods depending on the stage and location of the tumors in the eye. In advanced cases, retinoblastoma can spread to the brain, making early diagnosis and treatment essential. Regular pediatric eye exams are important for early detection of this condition.
