This condition is referred to as synostosis of the coronal and sagittal sutures respectively, or complex craniosynostosis. This occurrence is less common, but possible. If suspected, a medical evaluation by a pediatrician, neurologist, or an orthopedic specialist is advised for proper assessment and management. Adequate interventions can improve the asymmetry of the head, promote head growth, and ensure optimal brain development. Molds and banding, for instance, are common corrective measures utilized in infancy. Expert assessment is, therefore, of utmost importance to help the baby achieve the best outcomes and improve their head shape accordingly. #BabyHealth #Crani", "z_wm": 10.988639831542969, "STS": 0.947265625}
