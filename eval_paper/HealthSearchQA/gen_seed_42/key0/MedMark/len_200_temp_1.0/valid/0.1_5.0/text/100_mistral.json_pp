This can occur through contaminated food or water, or through close contact with an infected person. There are also a small number of cases caused by sexual contact. Prevention includes good hand hygiene, particularly after using the toilet, frequent hand washing before preparing or eating food, cooked foods and adequate irrigation of salads or fruits if they have been rinsed before consumption. There is also a safe and effective hepatitis A vaccine available. Injections ofimmunoglobulin for hepatitis A can provide short-term protective antibodies for those at high risk of infection, for example, people traveling to endemic areas or for those with clinetry or personal exposures in settings where infection is common, such as in the day care, sewage or the food industry.

[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Yes, a baby can have both plagiocephaly (flattening of the skull on one side) and brachycephaly (shortening and flattening of the skull in the front-back direction). This condition is known as syndromic or complex craniosynostosis. It is less common than having just one type of skull deformity. If you suspect your baby may have both types of deformities, consult a healthcare professional for an evaluation and appropriate management options. Early intervention can improve the outcomes.

This combination is called scaphocephaly or boat-shaped skull. It's relatively rare but possible. If you suspect your baby has both conditions, consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and recommendations on treatment. In most cases, a combination of repositioning techniques, physiotherapy, and sometimes wearing a cranial helmet can improve the asymmetry of the skulls. In extreme cases, a surgical intervention might be required. A comprehensive assessment by a qualified healthcare professional with experience in the diagnosis and management of cranial deformities will help determine the best course of treatment for your baby. #BabyHealth #SkullDeformities #MedicalAdvice #ExpertAnswerFromARead", "z_wm": 7.80505895614624, "STS": 0.9296875}
