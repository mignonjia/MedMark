[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "The progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can vary greatly from person to person. Some people may experience only very mild symptoms, while others may develop more severe vision loss. In general, the early stages of AMD can last for several years or even decades before progressing to more advanced stages. The intermediate and late stages of AMD can progress more rapidly, leading to significant vision loss in a matter of months or years. There is no cure for AMD, but early detection and treatment can help slow its progression and prevent further vision loss. It's important for individuals with AMD to work closely with their healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment plan and manage their condition. Regular follow-up appointments and lifestyle modifications, such as eating a healthy diet, not smoking, and getting regular exercise, can also help slow the progression of AMD.

Some people may experience only very slow or no progression of the disease over decades, while others may rapidly develop more severe forms of AMD leading to significant vision loss within a few years. On average, the more rapid progression to advanced AMD stages with significant vision loss occurs over a period of about 10 years. However, frequent monitoring by an eye care professional and early intervention with approved treatments can help reduce the risk of progression and the associated vision loss. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition, exercising regularly, not smoking, protecting your eyes from sun exposure, and monitoring other modifiable risk factors can also slow down the progression of AMD.

This can lead to various symptoms such as increased thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and decreased urine output. Severe dehydration can cause more serious issues like low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, confusion, seizures, and even organ failure. It's important to maintain proper hydration to support essential bodily functions like digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. In order to prevent dehydration, make sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day, especially during physical activity or in hot environments.

Without water, the body can't replace lost fluid, couldn't remove waste or support certain metabolic reactions, and the concentration of salts and electrolytes in the blood could increase and lead to severe medical consequences.
