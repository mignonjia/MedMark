[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "When your body is dehydrated, it means that you have lost more fluids than you have taken in, resulting in an imbalance. This can lead to various symptoms such as increased thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and decreased urine output. Severe dehydration can cause more serious issues like low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, confusion, seizures, and even organ failure. It's important to maintain proper hydration to support essential bodily functions like digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. In order to prevent dehydration, make sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day, especially during physical activity or in hot environments. If you suspect you are severely dehydrated, consult a healthcare professional.\n\nYou can also check out the Mayo Clinic's website for more detailed information: https://www.may", "gen_completion": "Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluids than it takes in, impairing its ability to maintain optimal function. Mild to moderate dehydration can cause dizziness, fatigue, dry mouth, frequent urination and infrequent urination of smaller volumes, constipation, and increased thirst. In extreme cases, it can lead to severe electrolyte imbalances, unconsciousness, seizures, shock, kidney failure, and even death. Inadequate hydration affects various body functions including organ and nervous system health, metabolic activity, body temperature regulation, and maintaining normal cardiovascular function. Important actions to help prevent dehydration are staying well-hydrated throughout the day, adjusting fluid intake in response to activity level, perspiration, urination frequency and/or urine color, and paying extra attention when exposed to heat and/or experiencing illnesses with significant fluid loss", "z_wm": 12.665792465209961, "STS": 0.86767578125}
