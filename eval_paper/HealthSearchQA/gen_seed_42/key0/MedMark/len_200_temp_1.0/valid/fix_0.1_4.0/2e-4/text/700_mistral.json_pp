It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, and while it can occur in adults, it is most common in children. It is usually treated with various forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Early detection and treatment can result in a good prognosis. Additionally, there are two forms of retinoblastoma, hereditary and non-hereditary, the former having a higher risk of developing in multiple family members. If you have any further questions or concerns, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or ophthalmologist. I'm glad to help answer any other health-related queries you may have!

It is typically diagnosed in early childhood, most commonly before the age of 5. The good news is that, with proper treatment, the majority of children with retinoblastoma can be cured. However, it is important to note that there are two forms of the disease: heritable and non-heritable. The heritable form can run in families, and in these cases, other members of the family may also be at risk. The non-heritable form, on the other hand, is not passed down through generations.Regardless of the cause, early detection is key to successful treatment. Regular eye exams are important for children, especially those with a family history of retinoblastoma or other risk factors. If you have concerns or think your child may be showing signs of retinoblastoma, speak with your pediatrician", "z_wm": 4.7495036125183105, "STS": 0.90478515625}
