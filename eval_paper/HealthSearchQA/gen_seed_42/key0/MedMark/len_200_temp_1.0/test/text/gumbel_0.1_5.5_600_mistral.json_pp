Patients with diabetes or rheumatic diseases, for example, are at an increased risk for developing trigger finger along with arthritis in the affected hand or wrist.

For example, red-green color blindness is caused by a deficiency or absence of functional green or red cones. Similarly, blue-yellow color blindness is caused by a deficiency or absence of functional blue or yellow cones. These deficiencies are usually inherited genetically and cannot be cured.
