Sour taste is identified by taste receptors on the tongue, specifically those in the taste buds located at the forefront and the sides of the tongue. In contrast, smells are detected by olfactory receptors in the nose. A food or drink can be described as sour due to the presence of acids, which activate the sour taste sensation. However, a food's smell can also influence our perception of its taste, a phenomenon known as flavor mismatch. In summary, sour is a taste and not a smell. In specific instances such as a food's flavor mismatching an unfamiliar or displeasing smell, people sometimes wrongly associate the smell with a sour taste sensation. In actuality, both taste and smell play crucial roles in the complex, holistic sensation of tasting food. A good example of this is a lemon \u2013 you'll recognize its pungent citrus smell first", "z_wm": 13.906404495239258, "STS": 0.93212890625}
