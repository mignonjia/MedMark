In medical reports and diagnoses, the term fracture is typically used to describe the injury. In everyday language, a bone may be described as being broken. There is no significant difference between the two terms, but it is important to know that they refer to the same injury. In summary, a broken bone and a fracture are interchangeable terms used to describe an injury in which a bone is cracked or shattered. #healthcare #medicine #bones #", "z_wm": 5.717436790466309, "STS": 0.92431640625}
