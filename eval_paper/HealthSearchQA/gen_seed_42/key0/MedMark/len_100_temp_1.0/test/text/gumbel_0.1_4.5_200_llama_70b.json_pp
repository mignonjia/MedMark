If detected early (Stage I or II), ovarian cancer is relatively curable. Surgery and chemotherapy can achieve a 5-year survival rate of 80-90%. However, ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage (Stage III or IV), when cancer has spread beyond the ovaries, making it harder to treat. In such cases, the 5-year survival rate drops to around 20-30", "z_wm": 4.037745952606201, "STS": 0.90380859375}
