These changes in shape can sometimes be an indication of underlying medical conditions and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. However, it's important to note that some changes in shape are normal and natural, such as the expansion of the uterus during pregnancy.

When an empty stomach absorbs food, it grows larger in size and shape due to the distension caused by the food, allowing for proper digestion to occur. Conversely, once the food has been processed, the stomach returns to its smaller, flatter shape. This ability to change shape based on physiological demands allows our bodies to efficiently handle our food intake and nutrient absorption processes. An excessive or prolonged change in stomach shape, such as from a gas build-up or a stomach ulcer, may result in discomfort or pain. Underlining this example, we can appreciate that change in shape is an essential biological function for the smooth working of our digestive system. Yet, it is essential to remember that maintaining other normal physiological functions should be a priority; changes in shape that are persistent", "z_wm": 0.5816746354103088, "STS": 0.7392578125}

Unlike some wound healings, pilonidal sinuses do not heal on their own without medical intervention due to the continued presence of a sinus tract and potential for continued contamination by hair and bacteria. A proper diagnosis and appropriate medical treatment, such as surgical excision, is frequently required for full healing. After surgery, the wound needs time to heal properly and may require wound care and follow-up to minimize the risk of complications. It's essential to consult a healthcare provider for guidance. The healing process may vary from person to person based on individual factors. In general, a multidisciplinary approach combining medical, surgical, and lifestyle modifications often leads to the most effective and long-lasting results.
