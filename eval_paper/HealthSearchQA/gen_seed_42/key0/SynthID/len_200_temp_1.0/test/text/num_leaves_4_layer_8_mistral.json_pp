Another example is the appearance of a skin tag, which is a small, benign growth that projects from the skin, resulting in a change in the contour or shape of the affected area. These changes in shape can sometimes be an indication of underlying medical conditions and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.

If you have any concerns about a change in shape, it's always best to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate assessment.\n\nAnswer written by: Dr. Hiral Patel, M.D. (Primary Care Physician", "gen_completion": "A common example of a change in shape within the context of the human body is the ability of the stomach to expand or contract in response to food intake. When an empty stomach absorbs food, it increases in size and shape to accommodate the food, becoming more rounded. After a meal, the stomach contracts and shrinks to aid in digestion and prepare for the next meal. This is an adaptive change that enables efficient digestion and nutrition absorption. Another example is the growth and development of an embryo inside a woman's uterus during pregnancy, where the shape changes from a pear-like shape to a more spherical one as the fetus grows. This is a physiological example of a change in shape. In contrast, a pathological change in shape could be a tumor causing a visible or palpable mass in the body, altering the normal contours of organs or body parts.
