When an empty stomach absorbs food, it grows larger in size and shape due to the distension caused by the food, allowing for proper digestion and absorption of nutrients. Conversely, after the food has been processed, the stomach contracts and regains its smaller size and shape. This dynamic adaptation to digestion is known as peristalsis. Another example can be found in the lungs during breathing, where their shape changes in size and shape with each inhale and exhale. These shifts in shape enable essential biological functions to occur in the body.

Sour taste is detected by taste receptors on the tongue. However, certain smells, such as the smell of vinegar, can enhance the perception of sourness. But the sour taste itself is not a smell. It's important to note that taste and smell are two distinct sensory modalities, and they work together to create the overall perception of food flavors. Taste is detected by the tongue, while smell is detected by the olfactory bulb in the nose. They combine in the brain to create the sensation of flavor. So while a sour smell may enhance the perception of sourness, the sour taste itself comes directly from the taste buds on the tongue. Sour taste is typically associated with an acidic substance, such as citric acid, malic acid, or tartaric acid.

Therefore, the sour sensation is primarily a taste experience, but it can be accompanied by a smell as well. In contrast, the term \"smell of sour\" generally refers to the aroma of specific acids or spoiled food, which is not the same as the sour taste sensation. So technically, sour is a taste, but it can be coupled with a associated smell.
