The \"1\" indicates the specific subtype of the H antigen. Swine flu H1N1 was a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans before the 2009 pandemic.

This designation helps in understanding the strain's origins and distinguishing it from other influenza viruses. It's important to note that swine flu can infect humans, and other animals like pigs can also be infected by different subtypes of influenza viruses.
