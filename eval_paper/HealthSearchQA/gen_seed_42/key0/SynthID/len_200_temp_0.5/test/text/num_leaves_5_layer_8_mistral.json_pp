[/INST]", "no_wm_completion": "Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which the exact cause is not known. However, research suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to its development. Mutations in several genes have been identified in some cases, but these only explain a small percentage of cases. The majority of MND cases are sporadic, meaning they occur without a known family history or clear genetic cause. Current research is focused on understanding the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the development of MND. It is important to note that MND is not contagious and is not caused by stress, emotional trauma, or physical injury. The disease primarily affects the motor neurons, or nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movements. As these neurons degenerate and die, the muscles they control weaken and eventually stop working, leading to the symptoms of MND.

This type of fall can result in the person losing control and falling unexpectedly.\n\n3. **Gait and Balance Disorders**: These falls are caused by issues with walking and maintaining balance, often due to neurological conditions, aging, or certain medications.
