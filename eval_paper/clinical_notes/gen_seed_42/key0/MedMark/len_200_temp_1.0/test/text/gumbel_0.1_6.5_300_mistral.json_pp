{"prefix": "<s>[INST] You are a knowledgeable medical professional. Given the following discharge summary or hospital course for a patient. \n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient was referred to our hospital following a routine chest X-ray that showed abnormal shadow in the lower right lung field. CT-scan and F18-FDG PET reported a well-defined tumor with possible invasion into the superior vena cava, inferior pulmonary vein, and diaphragm. Differential diagnosis included thymoma, thymic carcinoma, and a germ cell tumor. Preoperative needle biopsy was not performed due to the risk of dissemination or bleeding. Surgical resection was thus recommended.\n\nTreatment:\nAnterolateral thoracotomy was performed to excise and remove the tumor from the anterior mediastinal fat tissue and thymus. The tumor was found to be a World Health Organization (WHO) Type AB thymoma without capsular invasion (Masaoka stage I). Thymectomy was also performed through the same incision via thoracoscopy. The adherent portion of the pericardium was excised and reconstructed with the use of a Gore-Tex pericardial patch.\n\nOutcome:\nMicroscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis of WHO Type AB thymoma without capsular invasion. The resected specimen showed a well encapsulated tumor with lymphocyte-associated and spindle cell-dominant areas. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient is free of recurrence 12 months after the surgery.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe optimal surgical approach for giant thymomas is still a point of controversy.

The tinnitus started suddenly 3 weeks prior to the visit. The patient had a history of arrhythmia and heart valve disease and was receiving rehabilitation treatment for cerebral infarction. The clicking tinnitus occurred mostly during mastication or when opening and closing the mouth.\n\nClinical Findings:\nOtoscopic examination revealed the tympanic membrane to be normal while showing slight protrusion of the soft tissue, originating from the anterior wall of the left external auditory canal (EAC) when the mouth was closed, retracting when open. The patient did not have any hearing loss or any other otologic symptoms. According to the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), the patient's score was 18.\n\nImpression:\nThe patient's case suggested a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) herniation at the time of mastication which caused tissue herniation into the left EAC at the time of mastication. This, in turn, caused left clicking tinnitus without any other otologic symptoms. From temporal computed tomography (CT) scan and TMJ X-ray, a bony defect measuring 6 mm in the left EAC anterior wall and subsequent soft tissue herniation were detected. At the right EAC, no bony defect or other unusual findings were observed.\n\nPlan:\nSurgical treatment for the left EAC anterior wall defect was an option but was not preferred by the patient.

The patient underwent an emergency surgery for endovascular stent-graft placement and her postoperative recovery was satisfactory.\n\nOn Postoperative Day 2, an ulcer was found approximately 25 cm from the incisors during a gastroendoscopy. The patient was provided with conservative treatment and a feeding tube was inserted into the duodenum for nutritional administration. The patient showed progress as the 25-day gastroendoscopy showed a significant reduction in the size of the ulcer. Further, there were no signs of mediastinal infection and pneumomediastinum, which led to Meropenem administration for 33 days until no fever and leukocytosis was normal.

The pain and discomfort continued to worsen, and the patient developed a unilateral swelling on the right side of the cheek which was edematous and erythematous.\n\nThe patient was put on antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs and was also referred to a dentist to rule out dental infections. The dental infection was ruled out, but the patient's condition continued to deteriorate with increased ocular discomfort, severe headaches, and sloughing of the ulcer which extended rapidly and involved the nose and both orbits with gradual loss of vision in the next 2 weeks. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to repeated seizures, altered sensorium, and non-coherence. \n\nClinical examination showed a large irregular ulcer approximately 12 \u00d7 10 cm in size on the right side of the cheek, which extended from the right lower margin of the mandible to the medial and lateral canthus of the eye, involving half of the right side of the lips, exposing alveolar gingiva and teeth. The skin around the ulcer was necrosed, indurated and edematous. The submandibular and submental lymph nodes were palpable, enlarged, tender, and firm. Although the primary cause was undetermined, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated, and surgical debridement of the ulcer was performed.\n\nThe complete blood picture and biochemical investigations showed a neutrophilic leukocytosis with left shift, differential leukocyte count of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and random/fasting blood sugar levels of 140/80 mg%, respectively. The patient was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B surface antigen seronegative, and the liver function and the renal function tests were within normal limits. The chest X-ray was clear and normal.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scan of paranasal sinuses and the brain showed right maxillary and ethmoidal sinusitis with deviation of the bony nasal septum to the left, mild erosion of bony nasal septum, and bone destruction.

Physical examination revealed a large, non-tender mass in the left upper quadrant. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a retroperitoneal tumor with two metastases in segments 7 and 8 of the liver. Pathology revealed the tumor to be adrenocortical cancer (ACC) with stage IV in the ENSAT classification. Adjuvant mitotane was initiated; however, because of serious, mostly gastrointestinal intolerance symptoms including nausea, severe malaise, and diarrhea, the patient could not reach the target level. EDP chemotherapy was initiated, and therapeutic LMWH was administered because of CT-documented portal vein thrombosis.\n\nAfter 4 cycles of EDP, staging CT showed significant growth in the S8 liver metastasis with unchanged primary. Palliative superselective trans-arterial embolization of both liver metastases was performed to affect tumor growth. However, an unfortunate home accident led to an unplanned delay in both medical and interventional radiological treatments. Soon after recovering from the skin burn, the patient was transferred to our center with diffuse abdominal tenderness, back pain, nausea, and dizziness; she was seriously anemic and showed obvious clinical signs of hemorrhagic shock. Control CT showed intratumoral bleeding in the primary ACC and non-viable liver tumors. Hyperacute trans-arterial embolization of the primary tumor was performed to control bleeding, and it was successful. One week later, the patient developed bronchopneumonia, which responded well to parenteral antibiotics.\n\nThe otherwise non-tender abdominal mass that was still present on physical examination started to obviously cause difficulties in eating normal amounts of solid diet due to local gastric compression. The patient refused a second operative exploration due to concerns about potential bleeding. High caloric fluid supplementation diet was administered and prescribed before discharging her with stabile vital parameters. She was referred to the multidisciplinary board of the university after a control CT.\n\nCT documented a large necrotic mass occupying the tumor region. Informed consent was obtained, and the patient was scheduled for surgical removal of the necrotic tumor. Before the operation, a septic condition developed with a large intra-peritumoral abscess descending down to the left thigh through the femoral canal. Ultrasound-guided drainage of both the femoral and retroperitoneal regions was performed, prehabilitation continued, and therapeutic LMWH was again administered. The patient was stabilized and with repeated irrigations through the drains, the femoral abscess disappeared, and the thrombosis resolved. Six weeks later, surgical re-exploration was performed, and the large retroperitoneal mass was successfully resected together with the left kidney (R0).

The patient received chemotherapy comprising of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) for three cycles, during which the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were reduced. However, a recurrence of the tumor was observed after two months of completing the chemotherapy.

The patient had a history of a large perianal abscess complicated by a vesicocutaneous fistula (VCF) 4 months ago, for which surgery was done with colostomy insertion. He became bedridden post operation. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, fatigue, decreased oral intake, and fever for one week.\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient was malnourished and drowsy upon presentation. He was found to have a white blood cell count (WBC) of 21,000 cells/\u00b5L with left shift, hemoglobin 12 g/dL, and platelets 236,000 u/L.

Upon physical examination, she was found to have severe tenderness over the lower dorsal and upper lumbar spine. Motor power was 1/5 in both hips and knees, and 3/5 in both ankles. Reflexes were exaggerated, with bilateral extensor plantar response. Sensations and distal pulses were intact. Plain X-ray showed gross osteoporosis with vertical striations in multiple vertebral bodies, characteristic of haemangioma. Magnetic resonance imaging spine revealed an expansile haemangioma of T12 vertebrae, which involved the entire body and caused significant cord compression. Haemangioma at the level of T9 showed a thin posterior cortex and minimal extension into pedicles. Multiple thoracic (T2, T4) and lumbar (L3, L5) vertebral haemangiomas were observed.\n\nTreatment:\nThe patient underwent surgery in two stages. The first stage involved the injection of absolute alcohol into the T12 vertebral body under local anaesthesia with 16 No. Jamshedi needle placed into the left T12 pedicle under image guidance. Around 8 mL of absolute alcohol was injected at a very slow rate of about 1-1.5 mL every 2-3 minutes. The needle was withdrawn when blood could no longer be aspirated. After 24 hours, the second-stage reconstruction of the spine was performed using autogenous tricortical iliac crest bone graft combined with pedicle screws from T7 to L2 and decompression at T12 vertebral level. T9 was also included in the fixation in view of severe localized pain over the segment, gross osteoporotic quality of vertebrae, and fear of adjacent segment fracture. Thorough curettage of T12 vertebral body was performed through the transpedicular route from both sides, and a tricortical strut bone graft placed. Minimal bleeding was observed because of preoperative ethanol injection. Biopsy specimens confirmed the diagnosis of haemangioma. The operative time was four hours, and blood loss was 450 mL.\n\nOutcome:\nPostoperatively neurological improvement was noticed from fourth day onwards. Motor power improved to 4/5 in three weeks, and the patient was mobilized with thoracolumbosacral orthosis. The bladder recovered within two weeks. Radiographs at six months postoperatively revealed no loosening of the bone graft or the pedicle screws. Computed tomography (CT) showed no absorption of iliac crest graft.

Surgical margins were free of tumor for both procedures. After three years, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection was performed for the third GC at the similar location. Adjacent non-neoplastic mucosa showed atrophic changes, and microscopic examination of the specimen revealed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, still confined to the lamina propria. \n\nTwo years after the curative resection, a follow-up colonoscopy revealed a submucosal rectal mass. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy revealed invasive adenocarcinoma with features similar to those of the GC resected 2 years earlier. After a staging laparoscopy confirmed the absence of peritoneal metastasis, a laparoscopic low anterior resection with lymph node dissection was performed.

He complained of pruritus and dark urine, although he showed no weight loss, febrile sensation, or chills. Physical examination revealed jaundice with icteric sclera. Laboratory studies showed cholestasis, and a CT examination was performed, which revealed diffuse, irregular wall thickening of the CBD, including the intrapancreatic portion of the CBD, with minimal dilatation of the common hepatic duct (CHD) and the intrahepatic duct (IHD). A small lymph node with a short-axis diameter of 8 mm was observed within the hepatoduodenal ligament.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed ductal wall thickening and luminal narrowing in the CBD.

The patient's medical history indicated HIV infection, which was diagnosed in 2006 due to HIV-associated nephropathy. The patient had no history of opportunistic infections, and HCV co-infection was not reported. The patient's lab results showed a positive Anti-HBc, CMV and toxoplasmosis IgG. Although the patient received several ART regimens since 2006, the patient had poor compliance. However, HIV resistance was not documented. During pre-transplant evaluation, the patient showed a persistently detectable HIV viral load (around 200-300 copies/ml) while receiving DRV/r-RAL over several months, with a count of 595 CD4 T cells/\u00b5l. Due to the low genetic barrier to resistance of raltegravir and the inability to exclude resistance to InSTIs, ART was modified to DRV/r 600/100 mg BID + dolutegravir (DTG) 50mg BID to achieve an undetectable VL and proper adherence to ARTs before kidney transplantation was performed. The patient responded well to the new treatment and was able to maintain good adherence. \n\nThe patient underwent a living-donor kidney transplantation in June 2017. The patient's immunosuppression consisted of induction with basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and tacrolimus. The post-transplantation course was uncomplicated without rejection episodes. The patient was discharged on tacrolimus 1.5 mg/48 h as creatinine serum levels were between 2.0 and 2.4 mg/dl.\n\nFourteen months later, the patient exhibited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and received local treatment. As there is evidence that sirolimus can delay the progression of cutaneous KS, MMF was switched to sirolimus. The initial sirolimus dose was 1 mg/48 h, then 0.5 mg/4 days.

She reported to have decreased vision in her right eye, severe ocular pain, and headaches. The patient stated that she was hit by a metal tip of an umbrella on her right upper eyelid and left eye, following which, she visited a local clinic and had the eyelid injury sutured on the same day because it was considered to be a surface injury.\n\nOn presentation to our clinic, the woman's right eye lid wound had been sutured, and her lids remained severely swollen. The patient's vision had deteriorated to light perception only in her right eye and was 20/200 in the left eye. The patient could barely open her right eye due to the severe ocular pain. The eyelids were gently separated, and slit-lamp examination revealed an intact globe with moderate mydriasis. There were 2+ inflammatory cells and fibrin in the anterior chamber of the right eye, and the left eye exhibited corneal erosion. Ophthalmoscopy revealed commotio retinae and intraretinal hemorrhage at the superior quadrant with mild vitreous hemorrhage. No signs of a rupture of the globe were noted.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) imaging was performed to determine the extent of injury and revealed irregular signals between the right orbit and the third ventricle. The signals were interpreted as brain edema, with high-density areas representing orbital bone fragments. Three-dimensional CT revealed a window defect in the superior orbital wall. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed edema of the head of the caudate nucleus and putamen, with the edema extending to the hypothalamus. Bone fragments were observed to have penetrated into the brain cavity through the inferior part of the frontal lobe. The patient was transferred to the Neurosurgery Department and was given intravenous hyperosmotic solutions to reduce the brain edema and antibiotics to prevent bacterial meningitis.\n\nSystemic condition improved with appropriate treatment, and ocular pain and headaches resolved within a week. However, the patient exhibited minor brain damage, resulting in altered memory. After resolution of the vitreous hemorrhage, a retinal break was detected superiorly on examination, and laser photocoagulation was performed. The retina remained attached in the right eye three months later, with full ocular movement and a minor scar of width approximately 2 cm at the superior eyelid. Vision in the right eye improved to 20/50, while vision in the left eye was 20/20. Decreased vision in the right eye was due to subretinal fibrosis caused by the choroidal rupture and subretinal hemorrhage resulting from the blunt trauma.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n\nBlunt trauma to the right eye and head, with commotio retinae, intraretinal hemorrhage, and mild vitreous hemorrhage.

He had experienced fatigue and malaise. On admission, viral marker assay indicated acute hepatitis and possible hepatitis A infection. Incidentally, main pancreatic duct dilatation was also found on abdominal ultrasonography testing.\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient underwent contrast enhancement liver dynamic CT and MRCP for further assessment of the duct dilatation and liver evaluation. The contrast enhancement CT scan was done by bolus tracking method and the liver dynamic CT consisted of four phases. In addition, the patient's MRCP images were acquired with a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner. On the patient's axial and coronal curved multiplanar reconstruction images using arterial phase scan, the CHA was found to arise from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and traveling through the pancreatic head parenchyma and across the main pancreatic duct, supero-posteriorly.

He did not present with any symptoms.\n\nHospital Course:\n\nUpon admission, the patient underwent laboratory tests and imaging examinations. Abdominal CT revealed enlargement of the body and tail of the pancreas, which appeared as a region of low-attenuation with an indistinct margin. A mass measuring 5.2 \u00d7 4.8 \u00d7 4.1 cm showing probable encasement of the splenic vein was found in the enlarged pancreas by contrast-enhanced CT.\n\nThe patient underwent a resection of the tail and body of the pancreas, splenectomy, and resection of four regional lymph nodes. No metastatic neoplasm was found on the liver surface or in lymph nodes during surgery. The histopathology findings supported the diagnosis of a pure AFP-producing neuroendocrine carcinoma according to the forth edition of WHO Classification of neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nPost-surgery, serum AFP levels decreased to 23.15 ng/ml on day 29 but increased to 180.9 ng/ml on day 80. Lymph nodes metastasis and a recurrent mass in the residual pancreas were detected by CT. The patient was treated with a somatostatin (SS) analog for 4 months.\n\nSerum AFP levels gradually increased to 1200 ng/ml 5 months after surgery, and liver metastases were found on CT. Hepatic metastases were treated with hepatic artery embolization and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in another hospital, and the serum AFP levels fluctuated around 700 ng/ml.\n\nThe patient's clinical condition gradually worsened, and he passed away 21 months after the original surgery.\n\nImaging:\n\nAbdominal CT revealed diffuse enlargement of the body and tail of the pancreas, a mass showing probable encasement of the splenic vein, and some enlarged peripancreatic lymph nodes.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging confirmed enlargement of the body and tail of the pancreas with poor enhancement after gadolinium administration.\n\nUltrasound examination revealed a cystic mass in the left epididymis.\n\nPathology:\n\nGrossly, a grey ill-defined nodular mass was shown at the body and tail of the pancreas. Necrosis, hemorrhage, and parapancreatic adipose tissues invasion were observed. Light microscopy revealed that the tumor tissue consisted of large and small solid nests of polygonal cells with a scattering of pancreas islets among them. The tumor cells had moderate amounts, granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm, and round to oval nuclei with mild to moderate atypia.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy showed that the tumor cells contained electron-dense neuroendocrine granules measuring 230 nm in diameter.\n\nImmunohistochemistry showed patchy expression of chromogranin A and synaptophysin. Tumor cells also showed diffuse immunoreactivity for AFP and focal strong immunoreactivity for HCG. Dot-like pan-cytokeratin reactivity near the nucleus, \u03b2-catenin reactivity at the cell membrane, diffuse CD99 expression in cytoplasm, and wide CK19 expression in tumor cells were observed. There was no expression of HapPar-1, CD10, CD56, or progesterone receptor in tumor cells.\n\nKi-67 index was nearly 25%. No differentiated component characteristic of adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, or hepatoid carcinoma of the pancreas was observed.\n\nFollow-Up:\n\nDuring follow-up, other tumor markers (such as CEA and CA19-9) remained within the normal range, except for elevated AFP levels that gradually increased over time.\n\nFinal Diagnosis:\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with a pure AFP-producing neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pancreas.

Neurological examination revealed grade 4/5 motor weakness in both lower extremities with normal deep tendon reflexes and sensations. Laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive protein of 81 mg/dl, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 111 mm/h. Her Mantoux test was positive of 25 mm, and chest X-ray was normal. However, a spine X-ray demonstrated destruction of the thoracic vertebra (T11) body and inferior end plate of the T10 vertebra with loss of disk spaces between T10, T11, and T12. The contrasted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine showed kyphotic destruction of thoracic vertebrae T10, T11, and T12 with abnormal high signal on T2 and low signal on T1 in addition to a large heterogeneous multiloculated prevertabral and paraspinal abscess extending from T7 through T12 with a peripheral thick wall that had low T2 and high T1 signal with intense enhancement.

Her husband is her first cousin, once removed.\n- After an anatomy survey at 20-week gestation, the fetus was found to have multiple renal cysts, and the patient declined amniocentesis. She elected for termination of pregnancy based on the presumed poor prognosis, which was performed at 20 weeks at an outside facility.\n- Evaluation of fetal remains confirmed bilateral renal cysts and identified bilateral postaxial hexadactyly in the lower extremities, suspicious for Meckel-Gruber syndrome. However, no evidence of occipital defect was noted. Sequence analysis for Meckel-Gruber syndrome was performed and failed to detect a causative mutation.\n- The patient presented with a second pregnancy soon after, and anatomy assessment performed at 16 weeks identified bilateral multicystic kidneys and polydactyly of the lower extremities. The subsequent fetus was female. The patient elected for termination of pregnancy again by D&E at an outside facility.\n- After multidisciplinary discussion of the case, the patient's family underwent homozygosity testing at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The male fetus was identified to have 7 regions of homozygosity, while the female fetus was identified to have 9 regions of homozygosity. Four regions of homozygosity were common to both fetuses, including a 5.75 Mb sequence on chromosome 14 (chr14:85,720,831-91,471,338), which is the location of TTC8, one of the genes responsible for BBS (BBS8).\n- After further sequence analysis, homozygous deletion c.624+1_624+2delGT splicing mutation was identified, which is expected to be pathogenic.\n- The family intends to use the mutation identified to allow for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of BBS in future pregnancies.\n\nSummary Statement:\n\nThe patient's fetuses were found to have multiple anomalies, and further testing identified a pathogenic mutation.

Aspiration of the lesion was performed under local analgesia and it released pus and blood, and a presumptive diagnosis of infected radicular cyst was made.\n\nThe patient underwent root canal treatment of tooth 34 and extraction of teeth 35 and 36. The patient was instructed to irrigate the lesion with antiseptic solution (normal saline and/or chlorhexidine gluconate) through plastic tubes that had been inserted in each alveolar cavity. At biweekly intervals, the length of the tube was monitored and cut in order to keep it far from occlusion.

A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed two nodular formations placed in the L4 nerve root, the first located proximally, and the second distally in the right lateral recess of the spinal canal.\n\nThe investigations done included a neurophysiologic study of lower limbs, genetic analysis, and brain, cervical, and thoracic MRI. The electroneuromyography of lower limbs revealed subacute and chronic right L5 neuropathy without muscle denervation. The genetic analysis was normal, while the brain and cervical spine MRI were normal.\n\nThe patient was closely observed for six months, during which the pain was well-controlled with physiotherapy and oral analgesia. After six months, the patient complained of progressive sciatica, and the motor strength decreased quickly and severely, prompting surgical intervention.\n\nThe surgical planning was total tumor removal with free margins. A right hemilaminectomy from L3 to S1 was performed, and the entire segment of the L4 nerve root was resected with clear margins. The anatomopathological and immunohistochemical studies showed a hypercellular malignant spindle cell tumor with a high mitotic index and moderate pleomorphism in a nerve root, compatible with an MPNST.\n\nThirty days later, the patient presented with symptoms of somnolence, anisocoria, diplopia, severe paraparesis, neurogenic bowel with flaccid anal sphincter tone, and neurogenic bladder. Sagittal T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI of brain and spine demonstrated hypertensive hydrocephalus, leptomeningeal enhancement, and contrast-enhanced masses throughout the cervicothoracic spinal cord surfaces.

At admission, the perineum and buttocks exhibited severe swelling, skin necrosis, and pain, with laboratory results showing leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. Computed tomography revealed a necrotizing soft tissue infection with large amounts of gas in the perineum.\n\nEmergency surgical debridement was performed to relieve the infection around the cancer site. However, radical surgery was deemed necessary due to the tumor's infiltration into the bladder and prostate. Pelvic exenteration was performed, resulting in a large defect in the pelvic floor, which increased the risk of internal organs herniating into the infectious wound. To address this issue, a fascia lata free flap was created from the left femur and used to fill the pelvic defect. The perineal wound was managed as an open wound, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 35.\n\nHistological examination revealed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma of the rectum with direct invasion of the prostate, vas deferens, and severe lymphatic and vascular invasion. The tumor had four regional lymph node metastases and was classified as stage IV, pT4b (prostate and vas deferens) N2 M1 (inguinal lymph node metastasis) based on the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma. Negative proximal and distal margins were observed, but due to the high risk of local recurrence, postoperative chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy were planned.\n\nThe patient resumed oral intake on postoperative day 2 and exhibited no postoperative intraabdominal inflammation or bowel obstruction. He continued with outpatient chemotherapy and underwent radiotherapy of the pelvic area while minimizing irradiation of the small bowel. Eight months after the surgery, postoperative computed tomography showed maintenance of the fascia lata free flap, and the pelvic space had disappeared. At 1.5 years postoperatively, positron emission tomography showed no accumulation of 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose in the pelvic area, and the patient remained complication-free during 2 years of follow-up.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis: Fournier gangrene due to advanced rectal cancer\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n\nThe patient should follow up with his oncologist to continue chemotherapy and monitor for possible recurrence.

Endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated a mass in the head of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed with biliary endoprosthesis placement. The patient was offered surgical resection and underwent an uncomplicated pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\nOver the first 12 hours postoperatively, the patient had polyuria and had consistently low serum bicarbonate levels in the setting of a normal anion gap and absence of a lactic acidosis. There was suspicion that the patient was developing euDKA probably because of his use of dapagliflozin. A serum \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate was obtained and it was markedly elevated. A urinalysis demonstrated glucosuria and ketonuria. After the recognition of euDKA, an intravenous insulin infusion was initiated and the patient was fluid resuscitated. Within 12 hours after such treatment, there was improvement in the \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels, the anion gap normalized, and the urinalysis was negative for ketone bodies. The remainder of the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated. The patient was educated regarding the benefits of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n\nThe patient was discharged on postoperative day 6. The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician. The patient was advised to continue taking his prescribed medications as directed by his physician.

Upon admission, the patient had a systolic murmur in the aortic area and a 3rd heart sound. The electrocardiogram showed 1st degree atrioventricular block, complete right bundle branch block, and ST segment and T wave changes consistent with an infero-posterior AMI. The patient had a white blood cell count of 13.4 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl, platelet count of 16.9 \u00d7104/\u03bcl, hemoglobin concentration of 9.5 g/dl, and elevated troponin-T, creatine, and creatine-MB concentrations.\n\nThe patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram that showed a severely hypokinetic infero-posterior LV wall, a 40% LV ejection fraction, and severely limited opening of the aortic valve. A coronary angiography performed in the emergency showed an occlusion of the proximal left circumflex artery and a 99% stenosis and thrombus in the mid right coronary artery.\n\nWhile undergoing percutaneous angioplasty, the patient experienced hypotension and bradycardia, for which etilefrine and noradrenaline were administered. The administration of these drugs was successful in stabilizing the patient's blood pressure and heart rate. However, during the procedure, the patient suddenly lost consciousness and developed electro-mechanical dissociation. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation followed by insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support were initiated.\n\nA repeat transthoracic echocardiogram revealed the presence of a moderate pericardial effusion, although the site of free wall rupture was not distinctly visible. The effusion accumulated rapidly despite an immediate pericardiocentesis followed by continuous drainage.\n\nAt this point, a left ventriculography was performed to detect the site of the LV wall rupture, using ACIST\u00ae (ACIST Medical Systems, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, United States). Contrast agent was injected by 10 ml/s with the total amount of 20 ml.

The patient had undergone multiple rounds of debridement and open reduction internal fixation of the fracture after an occupational forklift accident at another facility. Upon initial presentation, the patient had a foul-smelling wound with inflammatory hypergranulation surrounding an open 3 \u00d7 2 cm bony defect and reported deep, throbbing pain. Diagnostic imaging with anteroposterior and lateral radiographs revealed a mid-diaphyseal comminuted fracture nonunion of the right tibia with overlying soft-tissue swelling.\n\nManagement:\nDirect bone samples were obtained for culture and pathology, which demonstrated a polymicrobial infection comprised of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus anginosus. The patient was started on a 6-week course of Vancomycin and Metronidazole. Given the patient\u2019s chronically infected nonunion and extensive necrosis of surrounding soft-tissue, a two-staged reconstruction using the Masquelet technique was performed. The first stage involved the removal of the plate and screws, followed by tibial osteotomy, and radical debridement of all nonviable surrounding tissue. A PMMA cement spacer with antibiotics was placed into the bone defect, and soft-tissue coverage was provided using a rotational soleus flap. The incisional wound VAC therapy was also applied to promote tissue granulation and accelerated wound closure. The patient subsequently received a 6-week course of Vancomycin and Flagyl after direct tissue cultures grew MRSA and Streptococcus milleri. The second stage involved the removal of the cement spacer and placement of a 10-mm radiolucent carbon-fiber intramedulary nail coated with Palacos R cement and locked with proximal interlocking titanium screws. The right femur was used for autograft harvest, which was loosely placed into the defect.

He had a history of metastatic nonsmall lung cancer and coronary artery disease. Initial chemotherapy was initiated, and a good tumor response was achieved. The primary tumor and the mediastinal lymph nodes progressed, and thus treatment was switched to a tyrosine kinase-inhibitor therapy. Due to side effects, the therapy was discontinued fourteen weeks later although having stabilized the disease and the symptoms resolved completely.\n\nUpon admission, the physical examination revealed a bradycardia, normal blood pressure, and tetraparesis. Laboratory analysis demonstrated severe hyperkalemia, mild hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis found. A rise in creatinine and serum urea level was seen for the first time.

Bacillus species was isolated from central venous catheter cultures both before and whilst on cefotaxime and flucloxacillin, later identified as Bacillus pumilus at the National Reference Laboratory.

The specific enzymatic deficiency was not delineated. The patient underwent an abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophrectomy. At 7 years, baseline investigations demonstrated elevated 17-OHP, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, and suppressed plasma renin activity. Findings were consistent with 11\u03b2-OH deficiency CAH. The patient was started on corticosteroid replacement and doses were adjusted as necessary.\n\nTreatment and Management:\nTreatment was suboptimal before patient presented to endocrine clinic in Canada. Corticosteroid replacement was optimized to a replacement dose of approximately 15 mg/m2/day of hydrocortisone. Doses were adjusted as necessary and increased to approximately 18\u201320 mg/m2/day of hydrocortisone on average. This was subsequently changed to ~3.5 to 4.1 mg/m2/day of prednisone. Despite this treatment, the patient experienced bone-age advancement and a slowing growth velocity which would result in diminishment of the projected adult height.\n\nAfter lengthy multidisciplinary discussions, GH treatment was initiated which resulted in an increase in growth velocity. In response to continued bone age advancement, an AI was initiated. Blood pressure remained elevated despite glucocorticoid replacement and further treatment with Spironolactone and Amlodipine were required for control. At age 12 the patient had insertion of testicular prosthesis. At age 14 hypospadias repair and release of chordae was performed. In addition, removal of breast tissue was performed at this time as well. The patient was not initiated on testosterone supplementation until completion of growth.\n\nFollow-up:\nThe patient had no adverse effects from GH or AI treatment.

Additionally, the patient suffered from abdominal distention and food intolerance, which led to further deterioration of her condition. Basic metabolic tests including serum ammonia, lactate, thyroid and liver function tests, blood gas analysis, serum amino acid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), urine organic acids profile were applied to the patient, however, all results were within normal limits. An auditory brainstem response (ABR) test revealed a severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in the patient, while the same condition had not been documented in either parent.\n\nTreatment:\nFeeding was conducted through nasogastric intubation (NG tube) at initial days of admission but gradually gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance of the patient became detectable and it was also found that she was suffering from severe abdominal distension. The seizure was controlled by administrating proper anti-seizure medications. Feeding was stopped through NG-tube due to progressive abdominal distension and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was conducted to prevent nutritional imbalance.\n\nDiagnostic Procedure:\nTrio-whole-exome sequencing (WES) test was performed to achieve an accurate molecular diagnosis.\n\nDischarge Plan:\nThe patient died due to cardiorespiratory arrest.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nThe underlying genetic cause(s) is a c.636_639del; p.(Leu212fs) homozygous frameshift deletion in the fourth exon of the ADPRHL2 gene.

She was admitted to the hospital due to her high risk of suicide, with a history of 55 previous suicide attempts, of which 15 were violent. During her hospitalization period, the patient completed 66 ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) via the Emotion Management Mobile Application (emma) for self-assessment. She completed 4% of the scheduled daily questionnaires and about 75% of the weekly questionnaires. The patient also frequently filled out the questionnaires in a spontaneous way (39 times), particularly at specific times, without a decrease in frequency during the study period. A qualitative longitudinal analysis showed that the EMA made via emma allowed for the capture of suicidal ideation fluctuations that were not highlighted by the clinical follow-up visits. Therefore, emma alarm thresholds triggered EMIs that were adapted to her condition severity. \n\nDuring the study period, the patient used the Call Module with a sharp decrease in suicidal ideation for emergencies and the Emotion Regulation Module just after for emotion regulation. She also looked at Pictures and listened to the Breathing Space Module. The patient frequently used the Safety Plan Modules, at least one module per month, the frequency of which increased at specific times. For instance, in July 2018, the high intensity of suicidal ideation evaluated ecologically by emma corresponded to an increased use of the Call Module. December 2018 was characterized by many spontaneous EMA completions, lower suicidal intensity, and frequent use of the Emotion Regulation Module.\n\nFollowing her hospital discharge, the patient had three admissions to the ED during the study period. The first admission was just after her hospital discharge due to suicidal ideation. She presented maximal suicidal ideation intensity that was ecologically assessed via emma.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid nodule was suggestive of thyroid neoplasm, for which he underwent total thyroidectomy with right cervical lymph node dissection at an outside Institute. The histopathology report revealed papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with lymph node metastasis. He was treated with 131I therapy and a posttherapy scan showed residual neck lesions. \n\nAround two months post-radioiodine therapy, the patient complained of a cough and worsening of hoarseness of voice. A CT scan of the neck revealed a mass lesion measuring 4.3 cm \u00d7 3.2 cm in the right thyroid bed that was encasing and infiltrating the trachea. The HPE review performed at our institute revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma arising in papillary thyroid carcinoma with extrathyroidal extension, focal insular pattern, and vascular emboli. The patient received EBRT to the neck and mediastinum with 6MV intensity-modulated radiation therapy with a dose of 70 Gy/35#. \n\nFollowing his EBRT, the patient complained of hoarseness of voice and a CECT thorax showed soft tissue in the right thyroid bed, compressing the trachea. He was started on tablet Sorafenib 200 mg twice daily given clinical disease progression. However, he developed Grade II Hand-foot syndrome and discontinued the medication himself. The FDG-PET/CT scan performed at this time showed metabolically active ill-defined soft tissue in the right thyroid bed, right cervical nodes, mediastinal nodes with new bilateral lung nodules. A diagnostic radioiodine scan was negative (stimulated Tg ~0.3 ng/ml). \n\nThe patient was then advised to undergo a 68Ga-DOTATATE-PET/CT scan to look for the feasibility of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. The scan showed Krenning score 2 uptake in the left hilar node only.

Several imaging modalities were used to identify the cystic lesion and biopsies were taken. A histologic diagnosis of cystitis cystica was made, with no malignant change. The patient underwent cystoscopy and contrast study of the bladder lesion with urethral dilatation and transurethral deroofing of the bladder wall cyst under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, the patient experienced ongoing dull aching left flank pain and hematuria.\n\nFollow-up:\nThe patient's LUTSs were relatively mild (9/35), postoperatively the patient had an improvement in frequency, urgency, and incomplete emptying. Testicular pain remains an issue secondary to the currently untreated varicocele. Repeat imaging identified a residual/recurrent discolored lesion seen in the bladder base along the posterior wall measuring \u223c1.5 cm and a staghorn calculus involving the middle and lower calices measuring 3.4 \u00d7 2 cm without causing any hydronephrosis or obstructive uropathy.

On examination, left eyelid ptosis and limited extraocular movements horizontally in the left eye with the pupil sparing were observed. A computed tomography-angiography (CTA) excluded cerebral aneurysm or other compressive lesions of the oculomotor nerve. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T2-weighted hyper-intense signal abnormalities in the occipital lobes bilaterally, appearing iso-intense on diffusion-weighted imaging, with an increase of the apparent diffusion coefficient, consistent with vasogenic edema. These findings were compatible with the diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Amlodipine and olmesartan were administered for persistent headache and elevated systolic blood pressure, which did not improve until nimodipine was added. On the next day, partial ptosis of the right eye developed, followed by bilateral oculomotor and trochlear nerve palsy. Generalized hyporeflexia with bilateral flexor plantar responses was noted. The Romberg test was positive. The finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin tests were bilaterally impaired, and an ataxic gait was present. On the 6th day, the patient experienced bilateral lower limb weakness and could no longer stand. The partial ptosis of the right eyelid progressed to complete ptosis, and both eyes showed complete external ophthalmoplegia. A test for acetylcholine receptor antibody was negative.

Physical examination revealed a huge abdominal mass, and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging verified a giant multifocal tumor with solid and cystic formations filling the space of the retroperitoneum, continuing to the posterior mediastinum and the small pelvis. Right orchiectomy was performed, and histology revealed mature teratoma. A staging CT scan confirmed a huge retroperitoneal tumor and revealed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and numerous bilateral lung metastases. He was treated with 5 cycles of Cyclo-BEP with minimal tumor regression and slow decrease of tumor markers. In that time our institution was consulted, and our head surgeon suggested a few step surgery. He was given second line chemotherapy TIP, but declined after one cycle. In September 2017, due to clinical deterioration, weight loss, necessity of opioid analgesia to control backache and recurrent acute renal failure after insertion of bilateral nephrostomies, the patient finally accepted operation.\n\nHospital Course Summary:\n\nThe patient presented with significant back pain and a massive multifocal tumor involving the retroperitoneum, posterior mediastinum, and small pelvis.

She underwent an abdominal hysterectomy two years ago because of an enlarging mass found in the pelvis. CA 125 was moderately elevated at that time.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nThe patient was diagnosed with a leiomyosarcoma composed of cellular bundles of spindle cells with medium grade atypia and presence of giant cells. The range of mitosis was very high, up to 50/10 H.P.F (high power field). After the hysterectomy, a single metastasis was diagnosed in the left upper lung lobe one year later, followed by a surgical resection. Three years after the hysterectomy, a spindle cell sarcoma was detected in the left and right gluteus muscles, which was also surgically removed. Four years after the hysterectomy, the patient underwent colectomy and colostomy due to a mass of 10.5 \u00d7 4.5 \u00d7 4 cm that was identified infiltrating the bowel wall and protruding into the sigmoid lumen.\n\nIMAGING:\nA magnetic resonance imaging study showed a mass with central necrosis located in the subcutaneous fatty tissue, in close proximity to the gluteal muscles.
